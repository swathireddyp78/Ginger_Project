#Ginger_Project

Created a web app with a page that links to 2 other pages:
1. The first page will display a list of new articles containing information relevant to psychiatry,
therapy, data science or machine learning. Clicking an article opens a page that displays a short
summary of the article's content and names of all the authors. Clicking on an author opens a
page that displays the author name and the titles of articles they've submitted to arXiv over the
past 30 days.
2. The second page will display a list of authors and how many articles theyâ€™ve written over
the last 30 days, sorted with the newest, most prolific ones first. Clicking on an author should
open the author page mentioned above
